# Friend Knowledgebase

When you know hundreds upon hundreds of people, it gets hard to remember 
everything about everyone. Friend Knowledgebase (FKB) aims to aleviate
this problem by allowing you to store information about your friends.

Remember birthdays, likes, dislikes, events you saw them, groups they're
apart of, their relationships, and more.
